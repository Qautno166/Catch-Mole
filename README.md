# Catch-Mole
The game builds in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the game we play the role of insect extractor. We have only 60s to extract mole as much as u can. 

# How to Play
To start the game, open the index.html file in a web browser.
The game will start automatically, and the player will have 60 seconds to hit the mole as many times as possible.
To hit the mole, click on the squares where the mole appears.
Each time the player hits the mole, their score will increase by 1.
The game will end when the 60 seconds are up, and the player's final score will be displayed.
# Code Overview
The game code is written in JavaScript and is divided into three main parts:

1 Setting up the game: This part of the code initializes the game variables and sets up the game timer using setInterval().

2 Creating the random mole: This part of the code randomly selects a square where the mole will appear and moves the mole to that square.

3 Handling player clicks: This part of the code adds an event listener to each square to handle player clicks. If the player clicks on a square with a mole, their score is increased.
